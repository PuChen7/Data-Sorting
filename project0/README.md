# Data-Sorting
This project takes a CSV file and sort data based on different value types using C language. 

# Running the program
The program can be implemented in Terminal using the following example command:

`cat csvfile.csv | ./sorter -c value_type > output.csv`

value_type specifies what type you want to sort.

# Assumptions
The format of the csv file is limited. The program requires the first row of the csv file to be the data types. There's no limit on the amount of data types.
